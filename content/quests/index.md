Quests are the mechanism for how to earn Strawberries (üçì, our in-game currency). To get started, you must visit the spawn town with the following command:

```
/spawn spawn_town
```

From here you can find an NPC and right-click it.

## Daily Quests

This type of quest is drawn from a pool of quests and involves basic tasks such as collecting resources, killing mobs, and breeding animals. A pursuit is assigned to the player randomly and can only be accepted once every 24 hours.

## Weekly Quests

Weekly quests are grander in scale and form the basis of the story arcs within Strawberry Pudding Craft; you will find storyline NPCs worldwide that will give you longer and more challenging quests that you can work on over several days.

## The Future of Questing

We want to build a story-driven world in Strawberry Pudding Craft; we want to use quests to make the server more immersive and entertaining. Expect NPCs characters with some personality who give quests that further the storyline.
